# m68k_Op_Doc


The goal is to have a full documentation of the motorola 68k processor family with all opcodes for each instructions and a comment where it confilicts with others in the family.

I intend to lay the groundwork for projects like capstone and radare on documentation of a given CPU family and the m68k is the one I decided to start with.
